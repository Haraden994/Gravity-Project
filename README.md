# Gravity-Project

Gravity Project is a Virtual Reality Game made for Oculus Quest/Rift as a university project for the Virtual Reality subject.

The player is an Astronaut that finds themself adrift in space with a limited oxygen supply and, also limited, suit-boosters to move freely. The goal of the various levels is to reach a safe place that can be a teleporter, a Space station, a safety pod or even a cargo ship passing nearby. Some other levels may have different goals, like saving a missing comrade or repair something damaged.

The whole environment of the levels is interactable and objects can be grabbed or climbed in order to move when the boosters are not available.
The game is strongly based on the third Newtonian law of motion, so objects have a mass and throwing them will push the player according to this law.
