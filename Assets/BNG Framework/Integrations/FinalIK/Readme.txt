Installation Instructions :

  1. Extract the oculus integration package example that FinalIK provides, found in : "Plugins/RootMotion/FinalIK/_Integration/Oculus (Unity, Oculus Integration).unityPackage"
  2. Now extract the FinalIK Integration package that this package (VR Interaction Framework) provides, found at : "BNG Framework/Integrations/FinalIK.unityPackage"
  
- After installation, you can run the demo scene that was just extracted into this directory (VRIK.unity). This scene contains a mirror and a few simple items so you can test out how IK works.
  
- Two-handed weapons are not currently supported due to how VRIK positions it's hands. Please let me know if you would like to see that feature in the future, and what other features you would like to see in this integration : beardedninjagames@gmail.com
